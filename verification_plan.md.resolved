# Task Manager Verification Plan

## 1. User Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] **Admin Login**: Can login successfully, sees Admin Dashboard.
- [ ] **Manager Login**: Can login, sees Manager Dashboard (Team Overview).
- [ ] **Employee Login**: Can login, sees Employee Dashboard (Personal Agenda).
- [ ] **Logout**: All roles can logout gracefully.

## 2. Team Management (Admins/Managers)
- [ ] **Admin Add Member**: Can create Manager or Team Member.
- [ ] **Manager Add Member**: Can create Team Member (Role selection restricted? Manager option hidden?).
- [ ] **List View (Bug Fix)**: Verify "Tasks Assigned" count is correct (not 0) for each member.
- [ ] **Delete Member**: Admin can delete anyone. Manager can delete team members (needs verification of permissions).

## 3. Task Management (Core)
- [ ] **Create Task (Admin)**: Can assign to multiple people.
- [ ] **Create Task (Manager)**: Can assign to team members.
- [ ] **Create Task (Employee)**: Cannot create tasks (or can only create for self? UI shows alert).
- [ ] **Assignment Bug**: Verify assigned task appears in Assignee's dashboard.
- [ ] **Visibility**:
    - [ ] `Public`: Visible to everyone.
    - [ ] [Team](file:///c:/Users/aryab/Internship/Task%20Manager/src/types/taskflow.ts#18-27): Visible to team.
    - [ ] `Private`: Visible only to assignees.
    - [ ] `Custom`: Visible to specific viewers.

## 4. Dashboard Stats
- [ ] **Admin Stats**: Total Active Tasks matches Sum of all active tasks.
- [ ] **Manager Stats**: Active Tasks matches their team's tasks.
- [ ] **Employee Stats**: "My Active Tasks" matches tasks assigned to me.

## 5. UI/UX
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness**: Sidebar collapses/expands.
